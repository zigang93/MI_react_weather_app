# MI_react_weather_app

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

## Scoring Criteria
- [x]  Accurate user interface implementation using Material UI.
- [x]  Presentable on different web browsers and responsive.
- [x]  Implementation of ReactJs best practices, e.g. reusable codes that can be used
repetitively, in different screens, projects, or by other team members.
- [x]  Structured and clean codes.
- [x]  Use OpenWeatherMap API to obtain weather data.
- [x]  Use Redux.
- [ ]  ~~You may also integrate usage of CSS frameworks in the project, e.g. Tailwind~~ (Flexbox css already good enough to go with this kind of small app.)

## My Extra Features
- [x] Add Search input to search from different location.

## Challenging
- Need to study the material ui API because i never use this.
- Need Study the API from openweathermap.org and need to return as correct json format that I want

## What should I improve?
- Still not clean yet, I always tried to make my code as clean as possible.
- Some code have 'WET' issue, maybe can improve..
- Add Typechecking? use PropTypes.
- Add Unit Test? 
- Error Handling from fetching data can be improve at Redux.

## Total Time to complete this test
- I think is around 10 hour ( Start from 25 May 8pm ) , include study doc from api/material ui
- I am very enjoy during the test, thanks! :) I am going to rest now~
